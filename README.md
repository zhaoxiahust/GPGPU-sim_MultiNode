GPGPU-sim_MultiNode
===================

 A version of GPGPU-sim that can use multiple compute nodes to accelerate its simulation speed. It can accelerate the simulation by a factor of up to 3.9 with a maximum error rate of 0.11\% on four simulation hosts. The detailed information is in "Exploiting Parallelism in the Simulation of GPGPU Program"
